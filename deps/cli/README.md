## Description

This library provides a `logseq` CLI for DB graphs. The CLI currently only applies to desktop DB graphs and requires the [database-version](/README.md#-database-version) desktop app to be installed. The CLI works offline by default which means it can also be used on CI/CD platforms like Github Actions. Some CLI commands can also interact with the current DB graph if the [HTTP Server](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/local%20http%20server) is turned on in the Desktop app.

## Install

Install the `logseq` CLI with `npm install -g @logseq/cli`.

## Usage

This section assumes you have installed the CLI from npm or via the [dev
setup](#setup). If you haven't, substitute `node cli.mjs` for `logseq` e.g.
`node.cli.mjs -h`.

All commands can be used offline or on CI. The `search` command and any command that has an api-query-token option require the [HTTP API Server](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/local%20http%20server) to be turned on.

Now let's use it!

```
$ logseq -h
Usage: logseq [command] [options]

Options:
  -v, --version Print version

Commands:
list                 List graphs
show                 Show DB graph(s) info
search [options]     Search current DB graph
query [options]      Query DB graph(s)
export-edn [options] Export DB graph as EDN
help                 Print a command's help

## API

This library is under the parent namespace `logseq.cli`.

## Dev

Most of this library is also compatible with ClojureScript for use on the
frontend. This library follows the practices that [the Logseq frontend
follows](/docs/dev-practices.md). Most of the same linters are used, with
configurations that are specific to this library. See [this library's CI
file](/.github/workflows/cli.yml) for linting examples.

### Setup

First install the following dependencies:
* Install node.js >= 22 and yarn.
* Run `yarn install` to install npm dependencies.
* Install [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka).

To install the CLI locally, `yarn link`.

### Testing

Testing is done with nbb-logseq and
[nbb-test-runner](https://github.com/nextjournal/nbb-test-runner). Some basic
usage:

```
# Run all tests
$ yarn test
# List available options
$ yarn test -H
# Run tests with :focus metadata flag
$ yarn test -i focus
```

### Managing dependencies

See [standard nbb/cljs library advice in graph-parser](/deps/graph-parser/README.md#managing-dependencies).
