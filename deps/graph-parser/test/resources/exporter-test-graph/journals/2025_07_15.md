    > The distribution of $x^n ~\text{mod}~ 1$ is more subtle. We have three basic facts.
    > 
    > 1. If $0 ≤ x < 1$, then $x^n → 0$ as $n → ∞$.
    > 2. If $x = 1$ then $x^n = 1$ for all $n$.
    > 3. For almost all $x > 1$ the sequence $x^n ~\text{mod}~ 1$ is uniformly distributed. But for some values of $x$ it is not, and there’s no known classification for these exceptional values of $x$.
