  The 'Page' parsed from the new file version is passed separately from the
  file-path, as the page name can be set via properties in the file, and thus
  can change between versions. If it has changed, existing blocks for both the
  old and new page name will be retracted.

  Blocks are by default fully cleared via retractEntity. However, a collection
  of block UUIDs to retain can be passed, and any blocks with matching uuids
  will instead have their attributes cleared individually via
  'retractAttribute'. This will preserve block references to the retained
  UUIDs."
