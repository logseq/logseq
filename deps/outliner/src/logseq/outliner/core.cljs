                    For example, if `blocks` are from internal copy, the uuids
                    need to be changed, but there's no need for internal cut or drag & drop.
      `outliner-op`: what's the current outliner operation.
      `replace-empty-target?`: If the `target-block` is an empty block, whether
                               to replace it, it defaults to be `false`.
      `update-timestamps?`: whether to update `blocks` timestamps.
