## Description

This page describes development practices for this codebase.

## Linting

To lint:
```
clojure -M:clj-kondo --lint src
```

We lint our Clojure(Script) code with https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/. If you need to configure specific linters, see [this documentation](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/linters.md). Where possible, a global linting configuration is used and namespace specific configuration is avoided.

There are outstanding linting items that are currently ignored to allow linting the rest of the codebase in CI. These outstanding linting items should be addressed at some point:

* Comments starting with `TODO:lint`
* Code marked with `#_:clj-kondo/ignore` require a good understanding of the context to address as they usually involve something with a side effect or require changing multiple fns up the call stack.
