# Plugin API Migrations

## QuickJS editor API v1

The DOM-free editor surface now includes `getBlockProperties`, `insertBlock`,
`updateBlock`, `upsertBlockProperty` and `removeBlockProperty`, alongside the
existing current-page/current-block/block reads. These are typed broker calls,
not legacy positional worker RPC. See the [SDK contract](../libs/README.quickjs.md#editor-graph-writes)
for supported insertion options, scalar property values and error codes.

Reads keep their existing grants. Mutations need the new independent
`graph_write` grant and an active command invocation with captured application
write services; registration writes are `Unsupported`. A read-only loader cannot
load write-granted plugins. `graph_write` is reported in the immutable session
metadata only when actually granted, and does not grant reads.

This is not full legacy write compatibility. Page names, page renaming,
currently edited block replacement, inline properties, schema/entity-valued
property writes and unlisted options are not implemented. Property keys are
restricted to the calling plugin's namespace rather than arbitrary keywords.
Missing mutation targets reject; missing property reads return `null`.

Freshness and cancellation are checked before sending worker mutations. A
mutation already dispatched can still commit after cancellation or a context
change; there is no rollback or multi-call atomicity guarantee. UI reloads remain
deferred during the existing command invocation window. DB evaluator budgets
and true query cancellation remain deferred. Native/headless graph verification
does not establish GUI, Web/WASM, iOS or Android support; no DOM/WebView fallback
was added.

## QuickJS sibling navigation reads

`Editor.getPreviousSiblingBlock(identity)` and `Editor.getNextSiblingBlock(identity)`
now use the shared typed broker and existing worker sibling query. Both require
`Graph_read`, not editing, command, or DB-query authority. Entity IDs, UUIDs,
and `{ uuid }` are accepted; page names are not. Results are immediate siblings
under the same parent, not flattened tree neighbors. Boundaries, missing blocks,
and absent graphs return `null`; malformed input, denied permissions, stale
context and resource failures reject using the existing `PluginError` codes.
Application OCaml callers use `Plugin_broker.get_sibling_block` with a closed
`Previous_sibling`/`Next_sibling` direction and the same session/invocation.

## QuickJS session capability metadata

`logseq.baseInfo.grantedCapabilities` and the `ready` callback metadata now
contain an immutable snapshot of the host-created session's actual grants.
The broker remains the authority; the list does not grant access or establish
API/platform availability. New SDK bundles require this metadata from a matching
host and fail with `Unsupported` if it is absent. See the
[QuickJS API/permission inventory](../libs/README.quickjs.md) for names and limits.

## QuickJS registered editor commands

The DOM-free QuickJS target now supports explicitly registered editor commands.
Rebuild a plugin with `@logseq/libs/quickjs` and register during `logseq.ready`:

```ts
import logseq from '@logseq/libs/quickjs'

logseq.ready(async () => {
  await logseq.Commands.registerEditorCommand(
    { key: 'greet', label: 'Insert greeting' },
    async () => {
      const block = await logseq.Editor.getCurrentBlock()
      return [{ kind: 'insertText', text: block ? 'Hello' : 'No current block' }]
    }
  )
})
```

The application must load the bundle through `Plugin_host.load_command_plugin`
with the `Editor_command` grant. `Editor_read`, `Graph_read` and `Db_query`
remain separate grants; the example also requires the first two read grants.
Commands appear in the editor slash popup only after activation succeeds.
Keys are unique per plugin, use ASCII letters/digits/`-_.`, and are limited to
64 bytes. Labels are nonempty, control-free UTF-8, limited to 128 bytes.
Registration/callback storage is bounded by the existing 32-call budget;
initialization and reads consume that budget too. Registration after activation
is unsupported. Unload, cancellation, runtime failure or stale invocation
retires the runtime and withdraws its commands.

Each handler must return an explicit array (`[]` is valid; `undefined` is not).
Actions are `insertText`, `showDatePicker` and `exitEditing`; the latter two must
be last. Results use the existing configured editor executor, replacing the
captured slash trigger only after validation. A one-use application ticket
protects the original editor/popup context, including delayed configured UI.
The initial slice requires a noncomposing, collapsed editor selection.
Programs are not atomic DB transactions; cancellation cannot undo dispatched
saves. Existing read/query APIs remain available inside each invocation.

This is a new return-program API, not compatibility for imperative legacy
`Editor.insertBlock`, `Editor.updateBlock`, slash registration or arbitrary graph
writes. There is no DOM, CSS, WebView or executable UI-source fallback.
Native QuickJS is the implemented host; Web/WASM and mobile hosts remain future
work, as do automatic installation/discovery and DB evaluator cancellation.
