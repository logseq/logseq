# iOS development

## Installation
- Install Xcode 13 from App Store.
- Install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)
  ```shell
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```
  Note: use the following commands from *ios/App* directory to fix **ffi_c.bundle** related issue for M1 MacBook [^1].  
  (Working directory: `ios/App`)
  ```shell
  sudo arch -x86_64 gem install ffi
  arch -x86_64 pod install
  ```
 
## Set up development environment
### Build the development app
- comment in `server` section in **capacitor.config.ts**, and replace `process.env.LOGSEQ_APP_ASERVER_URL` with your `http://your-local-ip-address:3001` (run `ifconfig` to check).
    ```typescript
    server: {
        url: "process.env.LOGSEQ_APP_ASERVER_URL",
        cleartext: true
        } 
    ```
- Working directory: Logseq root directory
- Run `yarn && yarn app-watch` from the logseq project root directory in terminal.
- Run `npx cap sync ios` in another termimal to copy web assets from public to *ios/App/App/public*, and create *capacitor.config.json* in *ios/App/App*, and update iOS plugins.
- Connect your iOS device to MacBook.
- Run `npx cap open ios` to open Logseq project in Xcode, and build the app there.

or, you can run `bb dev:ios-app` to do those steps with one command if you are on MacOS. To download bb, see https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation. Also, in order to use mobile bb tasks on macOS, `gsed` needs to be installed in your system (run `brew install gnu-sed` to install).

Note: if the dev build isn't reflecting the change of code, restart `yarn app-watch` and run `npx cap sync ios` again.

### Build the release app
- Comment out `server` section above in **capacitor.config.ts**.
- Connect your iOS device to MacBook.
- Run `yarn run-ios-release` to install the release app to your iOS device.

or, you can run `bb release:ios-app` to do those steps with one command.

- In Android Studio, open **Run** -> **Run** to run Logseq.
- After logseq startup in Android virtual device, repl should be able to connect
- For browser console print and devtool remote debug, open chrome, type url chrome://inspect/#devices, you should see your device there, click inspect


### Build a release and install it to your android device 
- Comment out `server` section above in **capacitor.config.ts**.
- Connect your device to PC.
- Run `yarn run-android-release`.

or, you can run `bb release:android-app` to do those steps with one command.

### Build an apk
- Comment out `server` section above in **capacitor.config.ts**.
- Run `yarn run-android-release`

or, you can run `bb release:android-app` to do those steps with one command.
