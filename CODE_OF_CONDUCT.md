# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

Logseq aims to be a project inclusive to the largest number of people. It is also not merely a note-taking tool, but can potentially become a community for collaboration and learning. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Policy

- Please respect each other. Do not dismiss, abuse, harass, attack, insult, or discriminate against others.
- Likewise, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
- If you feel being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please report the incident(s) either by contacting the moderators on the [Forum](https://discuss.logseq.com), [Discord](https://discord.gg/KpN4eHY) channel, Tienson Qin (@tiensonqin) on GitHub, or the official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/logseq). We will work with you to resolve the issue promptly.
