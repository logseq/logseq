  "Fns to sync assets.
  some notes:
  - has :logseq.property.asset/type
  - block/content, store the asset name
  - an asset-block not having :file/path indicates need to download asset from server
  - an asset-block not having :logseq.property.asset/remote-metadata
    indicates need to upload the asset to server
  - if an asset-block doesn't have both :file/path and :logseq.property.asset/remote-metadata,
    it means the other client hasn't uploaded the asset to server
