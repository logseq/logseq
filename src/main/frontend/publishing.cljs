;; The publishing site should be as thin as possible.
;; Both files and git libraries can be removed.
;; Maybe we can remove some handlers and components too.

;; There should be two publishing modes:
;; 1. Graph version, similar to logseq.com
;; 2. Traditional blog version, much faster to load
;; We might host the pages or blocks directly on logseq.com in the future.

;; How to publish?
;; 1. When you click a publish button, it'll downloads a zip which includes the
;;    html, css, javascript and other files (image, mp3, etc.), the serialized
;;    data should include all the public pages and blocks.
;; 2. Built-in sync with GitHub Pages, you should specify a GitHub repo for publishing.
