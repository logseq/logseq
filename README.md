A local-first, non-linear, outliner notebook for organizing and sharing your personal knowledge base.

Use it to organize your todo list, to write your journals, or to record your unique life.

## Why Logseq?

[Logseq](https://logseq.com) is a platform for knowledge management and collaboration. It focuses on privacy, longevity, and [user control](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).

The server will never store or analyze your private notes. Your data are plain text files and we currently support both Markdown and Emacs Org mode (more to be added soon).

In the unlikely event that the website is down or cannot be maintained, your data is, and will always be yours.
