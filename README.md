## ü§î Why Logseq?

[Logseq](https://logseq.com) is a **knowledge management** and **collaboration** platform. It focuses on **privacy**, **longevity**, and [**user control**](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). Logseq offers a range of **powerful tools** for **knowledge management**, **collaboration**, **PDF annotation**, and **task management** with support for multiple file formats, including **Markdown** and **Org-mode**, and **various features** for organizing and structuring your notes.

Logseq's **Whiteboard** feature lets you organize your knowledge and ideas using a spatial **canvas** with **shapes**, **drawings**, **website embeds**, and **connectors**. You can **visually group** and **link** your **notes** and external media (such as **videos** and **images**), enabling visual thinkers to compose, remix, **annotate**, and connect content from their knowledge base and emerging thoughts in a new way.

In addition to its core features, Logseq has a growing ecosystem of **plugins** and **themes** that enable a wide range of workflows and **customization** options. **Mobile apps** are also available, providing access to most of the features of the desktop application. Whether you're a student, a professional, or anyone who values a clear and organized approach to managing your ideas and notes, Logseq is an excellent choice for anyone looking to improve their productivity and streamline their workflow.
