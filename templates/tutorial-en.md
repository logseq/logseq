## Hi, welcome to Logseq!
- Logseq is a _privacy-first_, _open-source_ platform for _knowledge_ management and collaboration.
- This is a 3 minute tutorial on how to use Logseq. Let's get started!
- (Feel free to edit anything, no change will be saved at this moment. If you do want to persist your work, click the **top-right** corner of the screen to connect Logseq to either Github or local directory.)
- Here are some tips might be useful.
#+BEGIN_TIP
Click to edit any block.
Type `Enter` to create a new block.
Type `Shift+Enter` to create a new line.
Type `/` to show all the commands.
#+END_TIP
- 1. Let's create a page called [[How to take dummy notes?]]. You can click it to go to that page, or you can `Shift+Click` to open it in the right sidebar! Now you should see both _Linked References_ and _Unlinked References_.
- 2. Let's reference some blocks on [[How to take dummy notes?]], you can `Shift+Click` any block reference to open it in the right sidebar. Try making
some changes on the right sidebar, those referenced blocks will be changed too!
    - ((5f713e91-8a3c-4b04-a33a-c39482428e2d)) : This is a block reference.
    - ((5f713ea8-8cba-403d-ac00-9964b1ec7190)) : This is another block reference.
- 3. Do you support tags?
    - Of course, this is a #dummy tag.
- 4. Do you support tasks like todo/doing/done and priorities?
    - Yes, type `/` and pick your favorite todo keyword or priority (A/B/C).
